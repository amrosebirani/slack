Forked from Slack API in Go [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/nlopes/slack?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/nlopes/slack) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nlopes/slack.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/nlopes/slack)
===============

This library supports most if not all of the `api.slack.com` REST
calls, as well as the Real-Time Messaging protocol over websocket, in
a fully managed way.

I am working on adding wrappers for the events api to this.

## Installing

### *go get*

    $ go get github.com/amrosebirani/slack

Rest is WIP.
